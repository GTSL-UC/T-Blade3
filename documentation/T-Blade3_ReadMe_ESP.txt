1.  INTRODUCTION

    T-Blade3 version 1.2 has been integrated with Engineering Sketch Pad (ESP) which is a 
    geometry creation and manipulation system targeted at aerospace design and analysis. ESP
    is used to drive T-Blade3 via user defined primitives (UDPs) which generate a single
    solid. Various spanwise parameters provided by T-Blade3 can be further manipulated using
    ESP input files which have a .csm extension. The resulting solids can be written in 
    .step files. Three UDPs have been provided with this release of T-Blade3:

    1. udpTblade.c         - used to generate a 3D blade
    2. udpHubWedge.c       - used to generate a blade and hub union (linux only)
    3. udpBladeVolume.c    - used to generate a fluid volume around a 3D blade (linux only)

    The latest ESP source code can be obtained here: https://acdl.mit.edu/ESP/ 
    
    This document explains how to compile ESP 1.15 using T-Blade3 version 1.2 so that NACA 
    thickness controls can be used.

3.  INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Refer to $ESPROOT/README.txt for instructions to compile ESP for the first time.
    2. Change to the following directory:
       
       $ cd ESPROOT/src/OpenCSM/
       $ rm -rf Tblade3
       $ git clone https://github.com/GTSL-UC/T-Blade3.git
       $ cd T-Blade3
       $ git fetch origin
       $ git checkout develop

    3. In $TBLADEROOT, execute make:
            
       $ make clean_esp
       $ make esp

    4. This will generate the executable .serveCSM in $ESPROOT/bin
    5. The sample input files in $TBLADEROOT/inputs/OpenCSM can now be run and modified
