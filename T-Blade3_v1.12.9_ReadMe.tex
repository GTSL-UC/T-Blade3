\section{Introduction}
\noindent
T-Blade3 is a general parametric 3D blade geometry builder\cite{KiranPaper}. The tool can create a variety of 3D blade geometries based on a few basic parameters. The geometric and aerodynamic parameters are used to create 2D airfoils which are then stacked on the desired stacking axis\cite{KiranThesis}. The geometry modeler can also be  used for generating 3D blades with special features like bent tip or a split tip\cite{AbhayThesis} which can be explored with minimum changes to the blade geometry. The use of control points for the definition of spanwise splines makes it easy to modify the blade shapes quickly and smoothly to obtain the desired blade model\cite{SyedPaper}. The second derivative of the mean-line (related to the curvature) is controlled using B-splines to create the airfoils. This is then analytically integrated twice to obtain the mean-line\cite{AhmedPaper}. A smooth thickness distribution is then added to the airfoil. This can either be a Wennerstrom thickness distribution\cite{WennerstromBook}, a smooth quartic thickness distribution or a new exact thickness distribution\cite{KarthikThesis}. B-splines have also been implemented to achieve customized airfoil leading and trailing edges.\\

\noindent
New in version 1.12:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Removal of static builds for Linux and macOS
    \item Smooth curvature control based on specifications of normalized meanline second derivatives which ensures curvature and slope of curvature continuity on the airfoil surface
    \item Exact thickness control capable of imposing specified thickness values chord-wise and span-wise while quantifying and optimizing the quality of the thickness curve based on curvature
    \item A modified NACA four-digit thickness distribution\cite{AbbottText} with control over LE radius and a circular TE
    \item Integration with the Engineering Sketch Pad (ESP) capable of using newer features to generate 3D blade geometry CAD files
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
This document contains instructions on how to install T-Blade3, run the code and details about the necessary input files.

\section{Obtaining T-Blade3}
\noindent 
There are two ways of obtaining T-Blade3 version 1.12:
 
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Linux and Windows 64-bit executables can be found on \url{http://gtsl.ase.uc.edu/t-blade3}
    \item Source code can be found on \url{https://github.com/GTSL-UC/T-Blade3}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
The latter is recommended. There are two branches in use currently: {\fontfamily{lmr}\selectfont master} and {\fontfamily{lmr}\selectfont develop}; both branches can be pulled from the link above. See \textbf{\ref{compilesec}} on how to compile T-Blade3.

\section{Compiling T-Blade3}\label{compilesec}
\noindent
With T-Blade3 version 1.12, static builds for Linux, Unix and MacOS are no longer supported. The recommended method is to clone or download the T-Blade3 source code and compile it locally. Below are instructions to compile the code. Here, \$TBLADEROOT refers to the T-Blade3 source code directory. 

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textit{Prerequisites}: Make and gfortran (gfortran-6 and above recommended)
    \item Using the terminal in \$TBLADEROOT, run\\
          \textcolor{blue}{\fontfamily{lmr}\selectfont \% make}
    \item This will generate three executables in \$TBLADEROOT: \textcolor{blue}{\fontfamily{lmr}\selectfont 3dbgb, tblade3, techop}
    \item To add to the PATH environment variable permanently, edit the .bashrc/.bash\_profile file (for Linux/MacOS only)\\
          \textcolor{blue}{\fontfamily{lmr}\selectfont export PATH="/path/to/\$TBLADEROOT:\$PATH"}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Description of Input Files}
\noindent
This section refers to specific examples which can be found on the T-Blade3 website (\url{http://gtsl.ase.uc.edu/t-blade3})

\subsection{3dbgbinput.bladerow.dat}\label{maininput}
\noindent
This is the main input file for T-Blade3. It contains all the geometric and aerodynamic properties of the blade to be designed. Following are the details of the file:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Case name: e.g. e3c = EEE HPC full definition
    \item Bladerow number
    \item Number of blades in the current row
    \item Blade scaling factor: The output coordinates are in mm. This value is used to scale the non-dimensional blade to the desired scale
    \item Number of streamlines: Upto 21 streamlines can be specified
    \item Input angle switch (line 12): There are several options to specify the angles:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
        \item Four primary options to distinguish between several configurations as below
        \begin{itemize}[label=\FilledSmallSquare]
            \item "$\mathbf{0}$": completely AXIAL machines with $\beta_{Z}$ angles at inlet and outlet
            \item "$\mathbf{1}$": completely RADIAL machines with $\beta_{R}$ angles at inlet and outlet
            \item "$\mathbf{2}$": AXIAL inlet and RADIAL outlet machines with $\beta_{Z}$ angles at inlet and $\beta_{R}$ angles at outlet
            \item "$\mathbf{3}$": RADIAL inlet and AXIAL outlet machines with $\beta_{R}$ angles at inlet and $\beta_{Z}$ angles at outlet
        \end{itemize}
        \item Spanwise definitions of inlet and outlet angles can be created by setting the angle switch (line 12) to "$\mathbf{0}$ \textbf{inoutspline}". This splines both the inlet and outlet angles using control inputs which are specified in this file further below as '\textit{in\_beta*}' and '\textit{out\_beta*}'. Refer to the example case \textit{spanwise\_beta\_spline} on \url{http://gtsl.ase.uc.edu/t-blade3}
        \item Spanwise definitions of incidence and deviation can be created by setting the angle switch (line 12) to "$\mathbf{0}$ \textbf{inci\_dev\_spline}". This splines both the incidence and deviation using control inputs which are specified in this file further below as '\textit{in\_beta*}' and '\textit{out\_beta*}'. The incidence and deviation definitions are added to the inlet and outlet angles defined in T-Blade3 in the sectionwise properties table (line 23). Refer to the example case \textit{spanwise\_inci\_dev\_spline} on \url{http://gtsl.ase.uc.edu/t-blade3}
        \item Any combination of the two options can also be utilized (e.g.: "$\mathbf{2}$ \textbf{inci\_dev\_spline}"). 
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Camber definition switch (line 14). If the switch is set to "$\mathbf{1}$ \textbf{spanwise\_spline}", the auxiliary input file \textit{\textcolor{blue}{spancontrolinputs.dat}} is used (also see \textbf{\ref{auxinput}}). Refer to the example case \textit{spanwise\_curvature} on \url{http://gtsl.ase.uc.edu/t-blade3}
    \item Thickness distribution switch (line 16). If the switch is set to:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
        \item "$\mathbf{0}$": Wennerstrom thickness distribution is used
        \item "$\mathbf{1}$": a smooth quartic thickness distribution is used
        \item "$\mathbf{2}$": a smooth quartic thickness distribution is used along with a sharp trailing edge
        \item "$\mathbf{3}$": direct thickness distribution is used 
        \item "$\mathbf{4}$": exact thickness distribution is used. Refer to the example case \textit{exact\_thickness} on \url{http://gtsl.ase.uc.edu/t-blade3}
        \item "$\mathbf{5}$": modified NACA four-digit thickness distribution is used
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Thickness multiplier switch (line 18)
    \item Leading edge definition switch (line 20)
    \item Non-dimensional actual chord switch (line 22). If this switch is set to:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
        \item "$\mathbf{1}$": the code uses the actual chord values from the sectionwise properties table rather than computing the meridional chord values (all non-dimensional) and then converting them to the actua values
        \item "$\mathbf{2}$": the chord can be controlled using a spline chord multiplier definition radially the control points for which are defined further below as '\textit{chord\_multiplier}'
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Lean/sweep switch (line 24). If this switch is set to:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
        \item "$\mathbf{0}$": tangential lean and axial sweep are used
        \item "$\mathbf{1}$": true lean and true sweep are used. Refer to the example case \textit{trueleansweep} on \url{http://gtsl.ase.uc.edu/t-blade3}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Clustering control switch (line 26): If this switch is set to:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
        \item "$\mathbf{1}$": sine function based clustering distribution is used
        \begin{itemize}[label=\FilledSmallSquare]
            \item Clustering parameter is an exponent, higher value specifies more clustering
        \end{itemize}
        \item "$\mathbf{2}$": exponential stretching function based clustering distribution is used
        \begin{itemize}[label=\FilledSmallSquare]
            \item Clustering parameter denotes the strength of the stretching, higher value specifies more clustering
        \end{itemize}
        \item "$\mathbf{3}$": hyperbolic stretching function based clustering distribution is used
        \begin{itemize}[label=\FilledSmallSquare]
            \item Clustering parameter denotes the strength of the stretching, higher values specifies more clustering
        \end{itemize}
        \item "$\mathbf{4}$": ellipse based clustering distribution at the LE and TE with hyperbolic midchord clustering is used
        \begin{itemize}[label=\FilledSmallSquare]
            \item Clustering parameter denotes the number of points placed near the LE and TE, higher value specifies more clustering
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate} 
    \item Sectionwise properties: This table contains options to specify the following quantities
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
        \item Flow angle at leading edge of a blade section ($\beta_{in}$). These values are not used when input angle switch (line 12) is set to "\textbf{inoutspline}"
        \item Flow angle at trailing edge of a blade section ($\beta_{out}$). These values are not used when input angle switch (line 12) is set to "\textbf{inoutspline}"
        \item Relative inlet Mach number 
        \item Blade section chord. These values are used when the non-dimensional actual chord switch (line 22) is switched to "$\mathbf{1}$"
        \item Thickness to maximum chord ratio. These values are used when the thickness distribution switch (line 16) is switched to "$\mathbf{0}$"
        \item Incidence angle ($i$). If ($\beta_{in}^{*} > 0$), $i = \beta_{in} - \beta_{in}^{*}$ and if ($\beta_{in}^{*} < 0$), $i = \beta_{in}^{*} - \beta_{in}$ where $\beta_{in}^{*}$ is the inlet blade metal angle. Thus, the inlet blade metal angle is computed using the user specified leading edge flow angle and incidence. These values are not used when the input angle switch (line 12) is set to "\textbf{inci\_dev\_spline}"
        \item Deviation angle ($\delta$). If the camber is negative $\delta = \beta_{out} - \beta_{out}^{*}$ and if the camber is positive $\delta = \beta_{out}^{*} - \beta_{out}$ where $\beta_{out}^{*}$ is the exit blade metal angle. Thus, the exit blade metal angle is computed using the user specified trailing edge flow angle and deviation. These values are not used when the input angle switch (line 12) is set to "\textbf{inci\_dev\_spline}"
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Leading edge/trailing edge definition at hub and tip or more if needed

    \end{enumerate}

    \item umxthk: Location of max thickness along the chord for an airfoil
    \item lethk, tethk: Thickness of the leading edge and ttailing edge. Do not use while switching on the LE defined by spline switch
    \item Jcells (Grid: 4n + 1): Used with command line argument {\fontfamily{lmr}\selectfont xygrid}. Defines the number of cells in the direction normal to the blade curves
    \item eta\_offset: Used with command line argument {\fontfamily{lmr}\selectfont xygrid}. Defines the height of the mesh around the blade as a percentage of the maximum thickness to chord ratio
    \item Background grid switch: Used with command line argument {\fontfamily{lmr}\selectfont xygrid}. Switch for enabling a periodic smoothed background grid for a 2D blade section
    \item Control table for a blending section variable
    \item Stacking axis as a fraction of chord: The user can define the position of the stacking axis as a fraction of chord. The first 3 digits are for \%chord stacking. The last 3 digits for stacking above or below the meanline
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]

        \item $\mathbf{-050030}$: Stacking at half chord and $30\%$ below the camber or meanline
    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
        \item Above the table is the number of control points which determines the size of the table
        \item First column specifies spanwise locations ranging from $0$ to $1$

\subsection{spancontrolinputs.bladerow.dat (current format)}\label{auxinput}
\noindent
This is an auxiliary input file for T-Blade3. This section describes the current format of the \textit{\textcolor{blue}spancontrolinputs.bladerow.dat}. The file in this format is used when the camber definition switch (line 14) is set to "\textbf{spanwise\_spline}" and the thickness distribution switch (line 16) is set to "$\mathbf{3}$" or "$\mathbf{4}$". It is used to create blade geometries by varying the curvature of the camber line and the thickness distribution through chord-wise control points at various span locations which are used to generate cubic splines for these parameters. See \textbf{\ref{inputs}} and \textbf{\ref{maininput}} and refer to the example case \textit{exact\_thickness} and the document \textit{Exact Thickness Control Manual} on \url{http://gtsl.ase.uc.edu/t-blade3} for information on how to use this file when running T-Blade3. Following are the details of the file:

        \item The TE flag can be set to:
        \begin{itemize}[label=\FilledSmallSquare]
            \item "$\mathbf{0}$": no TE is created
            \item "$\mathbf{1}$": blunt TE is created. If the last specified thickness point is (1,0), sharp TE is created
        \end{itemize}
        \item The LE optimization flag can be set to:
        \begin{itemize}[label=\FilledSmallSquare]
            \item "$\mathbf{0}$": the slope specified in the letht column is imposed

            \item "$\mathbf{2}$": the slope is optimized and the letht column is used as the initial value
        \end{itemize}
        \item The TE optimization flag can be set to:

            \item "$\mathbf{0}$": the slope specified in the tetht column is imposed, $2^{nd}$ and $3^{rd}$ derivatives at TE are $0$
            \item "$\mathbf{1}$": the slope is optimized, tetht column is used as the initial value, $2^{nd}$ and $3^{rd}$ derivatives at TE are $0$
            \item "$\mathbf{2}$": all three derivatives are optimized, tetht column is used as the initial value, $2^{nd}$ and $3^{rd}$ derivatives at TE may not be $0$

        \item The first column specifies spanwise locations ranging from $0$ to $1$
        \item The next $ncp$ columns specify control points for chord-wise locations for a section:
        \begin{itemize}[label=\FilledSmallSquare]
            \item The control points in the first chord-wise location column are assumed to be at the end of the LE, the LE thus extends from $u = 0$ to $u = u_{1}$
            \item The control points in the final chord-wise location column are assumed to be at the beginning of the TE, the TE thus extends from $u = u_{ncp}$ to $u = 1$
        \end{itemize}
        \item The next $ncp$ columns specify control points for the thickness distribution in a section
    \end{enumerate}
